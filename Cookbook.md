## Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

**Names of the Original Datasets**

1) Values of Varible Activity consist of data from "Y_train.txt" and "Y_test.txt"
2) values of Varible Subject consist of data from "subject_train.txt" and subject_test.txt"
3) Values of Varibles Features consist of data from "X_train.txt" and "X_test.txt"
4) Names of Varibles Features come from "features.txt"
5) levels of Varible Activity come from "activity_labels.txt"

So we will use Activity, Subject and Features as part of descriptive variable names for data in data frame

**The transformed datasets**

*Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set*
 Data_Com.R

*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement*
 DATA.R

*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set*
 DATA_Descriptive2.R

*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names*
 DATA_Descriptive2.R

*From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each subject and each activity*
 Data2Tidy.R

*Writing a second tidy data in text file*
 TidyDataset.txt
