## Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

**Names of the Original Datasets**

Values of Varible Activity consist of data from "Y_train.txt" and "Y_test.txt"
values of Varible Subject consist of data from "subject_train.txt" and subject_test.txt"
Values of Varibles Features consist of data from "X_train.txt" and "X_test.txt"
Names of Varibles Features come from "features.txt"
levels of Varible Activity come from "activity_labels.txt"

So we will use Activity, Subject and Features as part of descriptive variable names for data in data frame

**The transformed datasets**

# Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set
1) Data_Com.R

# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
1) DATA.R

# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
1) DATA_Descriptive2.R

# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
1) DATA_Descriptive2.R

# From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each subject and each activity
1) Data2Tidy.R

# Writing a second tidy data in text file
1) TidyDataset.txt
